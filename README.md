### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m regularly updating my repositories to show my emerging data analytics/ data science skills
- 🌱 Systemic psychotherapy is also something I'm currently training in
- 🤖 I am passionate about systems theory - A LOT
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data for good projects or digital health application/ therapeutics data 
- 🤔 I’m ready for a new career step - don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you have a job opportunity!
- 💬 Ask me about my background in psychology and how I plan to combine it with data analytics

  Trivia:
- 🦐 My hyperfocused work style usually results in me sitting in front of a screen like a shrimp, coffee-soaked, and not letting go until the problem is solved
- 🧗🏼‍♂️ To maintain my mental and spinal health, I have recently discovered the beauty of problem solving on bouldering walls and am also passionate about hiking and Aerial Hoop
